# SecureAuth Node.js

SecureAuth Node.js is a robust backend system designed to handle user authentication securely, built with Node.js and MongoDB. This project offers a comprehensive solution for managing user accounts, sessions, and authentication processes within web applications.

## Key Features

- **User Management:** Create, update, and delete user accounts with ease. Securely store user credentials and personal information in MongoDB.
- **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify user identities and protect sensitive endpoints.
- **Password Hashing:** Utilize industry-standard encryption techniques like bcrypt to securely hash and store user passwords, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
- **Session Management:** Manage user sessions effectively to track authenticated users across multiple requests and maintain session state securely.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control user access privileges based on predefined roles and permissions, enhancing application security and scalability.
- **Middleware Integration:** Integrate middleware libraries and frameworks seamlessly to enhance security features, such as express-session for session management and passport.js for authentication strategies.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle authentication failures, input validation errors, and other runtime exceptions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring functionalities to track authentication activities, detect suspicious behavior, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A powerful runtime environment for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **MongoDB:** A flexible and scalable NoSQL database for storing and managing user data securely.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing essential features for building web applications.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects.
- **bcrypt:** A password-hashing function designed to protect user passwords against brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks.
- **Passport.js:** An authentication middleware for Node.js that supports various authentication strategies, including JWT, OAuth, and OpenID.
